# ImGuess
>***ImGuess*** is a Image Guessing program in python using self-implemented neural networks and genetic algorithms.

Using the [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html) libraries as well as the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset, ImGuess trains neural networks to recognize images from ten different categories all within a simple GUI. This repository is a side-project intended for self-learning basic concepts of machine learning and how to implement them without using existing libraries such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## Features
***ImGuess*** allows you to:
- :muscle: **Train** neural networks to recognize images!
- :family: **Breed** neural netwarks to create even smarter ones!
- :camera: **Upload** your own images to see if the neural networks can guess them!
- :floppy_disk: **Save** your neural network to train it again later!

## Usage
***ImGuess*** is currently under development and can't be used at this time.
